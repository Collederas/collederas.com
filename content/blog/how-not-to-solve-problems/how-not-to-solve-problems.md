## The Debugging Spiral of Despair

Picture this: You're debugging a complex piece of code that's been giving you trouble for hours. Your screen is filled with half-attempted fixes, each more desperate than the last. You've stopped thinking and started clicking—trying random solutions, hoping something will magically work. Sound familiar?

## A Personal Wake-Up Call

In a [recent post](/blog/unreal-debug), I explained how to debug a packaged Unreal build to investigate a very peculiar crash my game was subject to—one that gave away very little information in a pretty opaque stack trace. Before resorting to the solution that I explained in the post, I was trying to delete piece by piece areas of my map, in an attempt to isolate what I believed was a corrupted asset.

Delete, package, test. Fail. Repeat. Mindlessly. All because I didn't know better and I didn't want to go through the effort of figuring out a better approach.

After hours of this madness, I had made zero progress and created an even more convoluted mess of half-deleted maps. At least I am using version control. But that's not the point. I was simply wasting time. Then it dawned on me. I was falling victim to the brute force approach.

## The Psychological Trap of Unproductive Problem-Solving

This is something I tend to fall into more often than I care to admit. But, with time, I've learned to at least catch myself and step out of it.

And it makes a difference. Time is valuable both for your clients, if you are working on contract, and for yourself. There are tons of better things that I would want to do rather than stubbornly trying to click my problems away.

I don't know how common this behavior is, but I would guess I am not alone. I guess it's partly psychological. When faced with a challenging problem that I don't yet know how to approach, rather than "wasting time" thinking, it feels more productive to just keep at it relentlessly. It feels like I'm working hard. When in truth, I am just spinning my wheels.

## A Better Approach: Thinking with Purpose

The solution is to take a step back and start thinking again. Approaching things with purpose. Rubber ducking anyone?

What I find useful is to think about it this way: you should at any point in time be able to describe your problem and also describe how your attempted solution proposes to fix it.

Can you precisely describe:
* What the problem is
* What you've already tried
* Why those attempts didn't work
* What your next proposed solution actually aims to do

## The Power of Stepping Back

Time is our most valuable resource—for clients, for ourselves, for our sanity. There are infinitely better ways to spend our energy than stubbornly trying to click problems away.

In my case, once I stepped back and actually realized that what I was lacking was more information, I took a deep breath and decided to learn how to get a breakpoint into engine code during a packaged game crash, in order to be able to devise a new, appropriate solution. As you can see in the post, just that step was enough: the fix took me just about a few seconds to remove an old project setting.

## A Final Reminder

I don't know how universal this behavior is, but I'm willing to bet I'm not alone.

Save yourself. Save your clients. Take a breath. Think. And act with purpose.
